## Overview

The **DC7 Stealth Address Generator** is a demo project developed for the **DevCon 7 Workshop**: _Better privacy
defaults for your users with stealth addresses_. This project demonstrates how to leverage stealth addresses to
provide users with improved privacy in Web3 applications. Stealth addresses enhance privacy in blockchain
transactions by allowing more private interactions, helping users maintain control over their personal information.

In this workshop, participants will implement stealth addresses to create private Safe signers and use them to
control Safe transactions.

## Workshop Description

During this workshop, we'll cover:

- Practical use cases of stealth addresses for privacy.
- Implementation of stealth addresses to generate private Safe signers from scratch.
- Understanding the interplay between stealth addresses and different product types.
